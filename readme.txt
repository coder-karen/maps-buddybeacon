Serving map tracks in real time via ViewRanger BuddyBeacon.

== Description ==

Maps for BuddyBeacon is a plugin that allows you to display map tracks over a set time period or live via ViewRanger's BuddyBeacon capability. The markers are shown on a Google Map, with an optional info box displaying map title, date range and distance covered. Info Windows provide information for each beacon (date, altitude, longitude and latitude).

Customization options range from map type (eg. roadmap, satellite, terrain, hybrid), to beacon and route colours, beacon shape, map alignment and size, and beacon time adjustment. 

To display a map in a page or post just add the shortcode: [bb_maps id="{id}"] where {id} is the id of the map you want to display, for example [bb_maps id="3"]. For more information see the 'FAQ' section.

Yes, in order to retrieve your beacon information including dates, locations and altitude from ViewRanger, and to show this on a Google Map, you need to provide this information. Links are provided to help you go through this process.

Yes, you can add as many shortcodes per page/ post as you want, displaying as many maps as you want.

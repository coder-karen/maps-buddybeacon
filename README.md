Serving map tracks in real time via ViewRanger BuddyBeacon.


## Description 

Maps for BuddyBeacon is a plugin that allows you to display map tracks over a set time period or live via ViewRanger's BuddyBeacon capability. The markers are shown on a Google Map, with an optional info box displaying map title, date range and distance covered. Info Windows provide information for each beacon (date, altitude, longitude and latitude).

Customization options range from map type (eg. roadmap, satellite, terrain, hybrid), to beacon and route colours, beacon shape, and map alignment and size. 

To display a map in a page or post just add the shortcode: [bb_maps id="{id}"] where {id} is the id of the map you want to display, for example [bb_maps id="3"]. For more information see the 'FAQ' section.
